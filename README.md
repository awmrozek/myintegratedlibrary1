Altium library for components at ETF
------------------------------------

Have you ever wondered how electronics work? Did you just go to LTH and don't know what to do with all the endless theory? Don't worry, I've been in this situation!

I've been to LTH wondering what all the mathematics is for, until I discovered ETF. This place allows you to build hardware and see principles behind most of theory you learn at the university.

Low pass filter? You can make it!
Laplace transform on a chip? What is it for? (Hint: MP3/sound compression) Got it!
Flip-Flops and logical gates, D-transform? You can understand it by building the stuff!

There are thousands of components to choose from at ETF - ElektroTeknska foreningen vid LTH. It is a fantastic source of fun for young aspiring hardware hackers and makers.

But - if you want to build a professionally looking printed circuit board (like the one in sample pictures), you want to make a design. You can do it with specialized software like KiCad or Altium.

Like this:

Here, we try to create a library of components available for students and everyone who is interested in hardware making. With this library you will be able to create some simple and even slightly more complex designs.
